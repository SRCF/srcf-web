      <p>
        This document outlines the details of the EPYC SRCF fundraiser. Please
        consider supporting our fundraiser to support the SRCF’s mission in
        providing free and flexible computing services to the entire University
        community. In these trying times, the SRCF can make a difference but
        only with your help.
      </p>
      <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
      <p>
        With the move to remote work and the SRCF’s offering of free video
        conferencing, there is increasing demand for computationally-intensive
        jobs which at present the SRCF is at risk of failing to meet with its
        current hardware. It could upgrade its current machines up to a point
        with diminishing returns but…
      </p>
      <p>
        The SRCF’s machines are growing increasingly old. This means that
        hardware needs constant “patching up” to account for their age and this
        results in growing maintenance costs. Continuous patching will work in
        the short term but it becomes unsustainable in the long term so instead
        we have taken this as an impetus to move forward. What we have opted for
        instead is to refresh our <code>thunder</code> cluster and bring it up
        to date with the most modern technologies in the server world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last time the SRCF bought a server was in 2006 and at the time it
        was meant to replace the single tower server it had called “kern”. Some
        would have called that a watershed point in SRCF history. 14 years
        later, we want to take another leap forward.
      </p>
      <h2 id="aims">Aims</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of the fundraiser is to purchase
        <strong>4x CyberServe AMD EPYC EP1-102</strong>, with a calcualted cost
        of £25,000. The machines far outperform anything in our current cluster.
        We expect them to serve for 5 years (the warranty period) and given
        Zen’s compatibility strengths, we could upgrade them without issues when
        the time comes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the short term, they will be deployed to serve an increasing demand
        for remote work and video conferencing, namely with the Cambridge
        Students’ Union Virtual Freshers’ Fair, resumption of teaching, and
        society events.
        <i><a id="timeout-disclaimer"></a>
          Editor's note: we wound down our first attempt at a video conferencing
          platform, called Timeout, in May 2021.  A future video conferencing
          platform deployment project has not been ruled out.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the longer term, they will replace our <code>thunder</code> cluster,
        which currently consists of 7 servers with an averge age of 8 years.
        There, they will perform many of the existing tasks the SRCF has
        reliably delivered over the last 21 years and additionally allow us to
        expand and acommodate an ever-increasing list of new services.
      </p>
      <p>
        A purchase of this size is extraordinary and unprecedented but it will
        bring numerous benefits for the SRCF and its long term projects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>lower long term maintenance costs</li>
        <li>
          ability to meet increased demand for video conferencing in Michaelmas
          stemming from the CamSU Virtual Freshers’ Fair and remote teaching
        </li>
        <li>
          better carbon footprint (both more energy efficient machines and in
          the reduction of the cluster size from 9 to 4 machines)
        </li>
        <li>
          better performance – these 32 core servers easily outperform any of
          our current ones which have at best 8 cores
        </li>
        <li>
          better space efficiency – one of these machines easily accounts for 4
          machines in our cluster and space at our Mill Lane rack is full
        </li>
        <li>
          improved web hosting and scalability – there are plans to offer
          multiple versions of our current single web server
          <code>sinkhole</code> to better host custom web apps and distribute
          user load across multiple machines
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each server will come fully prepared with the necessary components,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>an AMD EPYC 7452 CPU with 32 Cores, 64 Threads, 2.35GHz/3.35GHz</li>
        <li>4x 64GB 2933MHz DDR4 LR ECC DIMM modules</li>
        <li>an extremely compact form factor - 1U only</li>
        <li>a quality motherboard with a BMC</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To contribute towards the fundraiser, please email
        <code>treasurer@srcf.net</code>. If you are a company, we will gladly
        offer you sponsorship benefits including a space on our website to
        introduce yourselves, inclusion of your logo on our website, access to a
        mailing list for advertising, and more benefits. In addition, we are
        negotiating to have your logo on the Virtual Freshers’ Fair platform in
        addition to Timeout, and would lead to massive exposure for your
        company.
        <i>[Editor's note: see <a href="#timeout-disclaimer">note above</a>
          regarding the closure of Timeout since this document was written.]</i>
      </p>
      <h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All donors to the fund will be mentioned on this page after the
          fundraiser is over. A plaque will also be made and kept safely in the
          SRCF server room for celebration purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the SRCF does not meet its fundraiser goal, it will extend the
          fundraising period past October but purchase the servers it can afford
          with the money obtained. These may or may not be of a lower
          specification, depending on the amount raised as a reliable cluster
          needs 4 machines to function.
