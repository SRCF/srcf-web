      <h1>SRCF Benefits for sponsors</h1>
      <p>
        The Cambridge University Student-Run Computing Facility is a
        volunteer-run student society that provides useful and flexible
        computing and networking services for members of the University. For 21
        years, it has attracted the interest of students interested in computing
        and technology and enabled them to freely experiment in a Linux sandbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SRCF is one of the university’s largest societies. We have ~2500
        active members from across the University that are proactively involved
        in using our services. Collectively, they maintain ~800 group accounts.
        Our full membership is ~10,400 members, which includes our alumni and
        past users. The SRCF runs free services such as web hosting, shell
        servers, mailing lists, video conferencing and more. A team of volunteer
        system administrators maintains these services.

          The society attracts a wide variety of users. Some may be interested
          in computing and technology while others may be a webmaster for
          another society. Across all these users, however, the SRCF has helped
          them develop skills in UNIX-like systems, networking and potentially
          programming or web development. What the users choose to do and learn
          on SRCF machines is up to them, though it’s certain they will acquire
          a valuable skillset for the modern world.
        </li>
        <li>
          The SRCF has a successful history of providing graduate recruitment.
          Its users and trained system administrators have highly sought-after
          skills in today’s industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          The SRCF runs production-grade systems: we use the Xen hypervisor for
          virtualization and professional tools, such as Xen Orchestra, Netbox,
          and NIS for management. We have written bespoke tools and scripts to
          manage, scale, and sustainably deployment using technologies widely
          found in today’s market (e.g. Ansible). System administrators combine
          the strong technical foundation required to run reliable,
          multi-featured infrastructure for thousands of user (including the
          Apache HTTP server, Munin and Nagios), with the soft skills required
          to provide user support across varied levels of skill and knowledge.

        <li>
          Today’s society runs on technology. We stand on the shoulders of many
          giants, such as those originally involved in the Xen Project, and we
          are a key educational resource for both users and our system
          administrators. By supporting the SRCF, sponsors can continue to
          guarantee that students get first-hand experience of the core tools
          and architectural principles of today’s digital world.
