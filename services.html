<h2>Services</h2>

<p>We offer the same services to both individuals (personal accounts) and groups (group accounts).</p>

<p>Historically group accounts were called 'society accounts', but we changed the
  name to 'group accounts' in 2020 to better reflect their intended usage. Group
  accounts can be used as a shared, non-personal account by any group of individuals
  who hold personal accounts. Group accounts are commonly used by college or
  university societies, but they might also be used to manage research or degree
  projects, social events, academic networks, and any other collaboration.</p>

<p>The guiding motivation behind most SRCF system administration policies is to
provide as much flexibility to users as possible, within the constraints of
security, manageability and affordability.  These policies can often be amended
quickly to accommodate the unforeseen needs of individuals and groups trying to
do something novel.</p>

<p>If you feel that there is a service or application that is not provided at
the moment, please feel free to <a href="contact">request it from the
sysadmins</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal and group accounts</h3>

<p>Each user of the SRCF has a personal account they can use to login to most
services (shell, files, webmail, and so on).  Prospective members can
<a href="<!--#if expr="${domain_control}" --><!--#echo var="domain_control" --><!--#endif -->/signup">
join the SRCF</a> to create their account.</p>

<p>Group accounts provide a separate space for one or more people (the
account <em>administrators</em>) to share control over hosting files or a
website.  We encourage individuals to become SRCF members in order to host a
  website for a society or group of people.</p>

<p>Any existing user may go ahead and
<a href="<!--#if expr="${domain_control}" --><!--#echo var="domain_control" --><!--#endif -->/signup/society">
create a new group account</a>.  We recommend all group accounts name at
least two administrators &ndash; this will help to maintain continuity of the
account should one of the administrators leave the university.  Admins may be
added or removed at any time, but new admins will need to sign up for a
personal SRCF account if they don't already have one.</p>
