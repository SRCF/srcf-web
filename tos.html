<h2>Terms of Service</h2>

<p class="version">This is version 2 of the Terms of Service, which came into effect on Monday 19th April 2021.</p>

<p>These terms apply to all services provided by the SRCF and your use thereof while you are a Member of the SRCF.</p>
<p>Any violation of these terms may result in us limiting your access to SRCF services and/or taking any reasonable actions that we deem necessary to prevent further violations, and the matter may be referred to the SRCF Committee and/or to University Information Services. We may pass on to you any reasonable costs incurred as a result of your violation of these terms. In the event of a dispute regarding the facts, or regarding the reasonableness of any sanctions imposed, the person accused/sanctioned shall have the right to appeal to the SRCF Committee.</p>
<h4 id="definitions">Definitions</h4>
<p>Any reference in these terms to "we" or "us" refers to the SRCF System Administrators as appointed by the SRCF Committee.</p>
<p>Any Member whose personal SRCF user account ("Personal account") is enabled at a given time is also a "User" during that time. Some SRCF services are available to Users only, more broadly to Members, or to the wider University community or to the public.</p>
<h4 id="incorporated-policies">Incorporated policies</h4>
<ol style="counter-reset: list-item">
  <li>
    <p>In addition to these terms, your use of the services provided by the SRCF is subject to:
      <ol>
        <li>the Rules made by the Information Services Committee: <a href="https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-made-by-the-information-services-committee" class="uri">https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-made-by-the-information-services-committee</a>;</li>
        <li>the Authorization for Use of the CUDN: <a href="https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-and-guidelines/network-use/cudn-rules" class="uri">https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies/governance-and-policy-documents/rules-and-guidelines/network-use/cudn-rules</a>;</li>
        <li>the JANET Acceptable Use Policy: <a href="https://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/acceptable-use-policy" class="uri">https://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/acceptable-use-policy</a>;</li>
        <li>all other rules listed at <a href="https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies" class="uri">https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/policies</a> as they apply either to you or to the SRCF.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>In particular, use of the SRCF for private gain or commercial purposes (such as a for-profit business, trade or consultancy) without proper authorisation is prohibited.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="contact-requirements">Contact requirements</h4>
<ol>
  <li><p>We must be able to contact all Users. If we can't contact you (for example, if our emails to you bounce, or if you do not reply to an email within a reasonable time), your Personal account and your access to services as a User will be forfeit. <strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that we have an up-to-date email address for you and that you promptly respond to requests from the committee or sysadmins.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="group-accounts">Group accounts</h4>
<ol>
  <li><p>Group accounts must have one or more active Users registered as Group Admins. If a User's Personal account is cancelled, they will also be removed from any Groups for which they are an Admin. <strong>If a Group no longer has any registered Admins, the Group account itself will also become suspended (and later deleted; see 10). It is the responsibility of a Group's Admins to maintain an up-to-date roster of Admins.</strong></p></li>
  <li><p>Admins of a Group account share joint responsibility for the upkeep, contents and actions of that account.</p></li>
  <li><p>Personal accounts must not be used to host anything which might need to be maintained by more than one person, such as a society website; you should apply for a Group account for this purpose.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="data-retention-and-security">Data retention and security</h4>
<p><em>Please see <a href="privacy">our privacy statement</a> for more information about how we handle your data.</em></p>
<ol style="counter-set: item 5">
  <li><p>You grant us permission to view any information stored, processed, transmitted or received by our systems for the purposes of ensuring correct operation, integrity, security and compliance with these Terms of Service and relevant legislation.</p></li>
  <li><p>You are not permitted to compromise or allow to be compromised the security, privacy, integrity or availability of another person's or Group's account or data, or of the SRCF itself. In particular you may not access another person's data without their explicit consent.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account(s). This means, for example, that:
      <ol>
        <li>no password may be easily guessable;</li>
        <li>you must not share any password or other security credential;</li>
        <li>you must not give anybody else privileged access to your account(s), other than by making them a Group Admin;</li>
        <li>you must endeavour to update any software installed in your account(s), particularly when an updated version fixing a security vulnerability is released.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>You must take full responsibility for dealing with the consequences you suffer from data loss or disruption to SRCF services. The SRCF is not in a position to make any guarantees whatsoever. So, for example, <strong>you must maintain your own backups of any irreplaceable data you store on the SRCF</strong>. We strongly recommend that you do not use the SRCF as part of any safety-critical system.</p></li>
  <li><p>We will delete all data stored in a Personal or Group account if the account remains cancelled or suspended for an extended period of time.</p></li>
  <li><p>You may not wilfully or recklessly waste or cause to be wasted the resources or time of the SRCF, its volunteers or its providers.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="changes">Changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li><p>We may make changes to these terms in future. If we do so, we will notify all people to whom the changes apply at least 30 days before the new terms come into effect.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any problems, suggestions, or questions regarding the above terms should be directed to the system administrators by email at <a href="mailto:soc-srcf-admin@lists.cam.ac.uk">soc-srcf-admin@lists.cam.ac.uk</a>.</p>
