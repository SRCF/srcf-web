    <p>We are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, harassment-free experience for members of the SRCF
      community.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>This is a Code of Conduct for the Student-Run Computing Facility. It has been put together from a variety of
      sources that are mentioned at the end of this document.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Be mindful of your language.</strong> Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,
            language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill
            level, occupation, or background</li>
          <li>Threats of violence</li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
          <li>Sexually explicit or violent material</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
          <li>Stalking or following</li>
          <li>Or any other kinds of harassment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone elseâ€™s thoughts or
          opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Be open minded.</strong> Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and
          we welcome positive change.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing <a
        href="mailto:committee@srcf.net">committee@srcf.net</a>. Please include your name and a description of the
      incident, and we will get back to you ASAP.</p>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in
      harassing behavior, the SRCF may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all
      SRCF spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other SRCF members or the general public.</p>
    <p>*Note: this is a living document and will change as we learn and grow.</p>
