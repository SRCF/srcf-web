<h2>Group accounts</h2>

<p>This is a list of all active group accounts on the SRCF.  If you are looking to become an admin of a group account, you should contact the group's own admins to request your addition.  If we don't have an account for your group, you can create one using the <a href="<!--#if expr="${domain_control}" --><!--#echo var="domain_control" --><!--#endif -->/signup/society">Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p>If a group account you're looking for is not listed here, it may be considered <em>unmaintained</em> (no current admins).  In this state, any web hosting and email delivery is suspended.  To gain administrative access to an unmaintained account, you'll need to <a href="contact">contact the sysadmins</a> for assistance.</p>
