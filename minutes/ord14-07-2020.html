        <li><strong>Approval of the use of internet banking</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With the new information received by HSBC, namely that permission must
        be officially granted to the primary user of internet banking to act on
        the SRCF’s behalf, the committee now recognizes and approves that
        <strong
          >the current junior treasurer, Matias Wang Almeida e Silva, is allowed
          to manage all of the SRCF’s accounts with HSBC via internet
          banking</strong
        >. It recognizes that they will be the sole
        <strong>Primary User</strong> of the account and grant permission to
        operate the account in accordance with their duties as junior treasurer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is not possible to hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) for the
        SRCF to write the aforementioned agreement into our constitution so that
        it may apply to all future junior treasurers, it notes here that such
        must be done once the conditions for an AGM to be held are met. This
        cannot currently be done due to the present disruption caused by
        COVID-19 and because it is stipulated that the AGM must occur during the
        Full Term.

      <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li><strong>Approval of the use of telephone banking</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Similar to the above, the committee also grants Matias Wang Almeida e
        Silva with rights to act as the Primary User on all of the SRCF’s
        registered accounts with HSBC via telephone banking.
      </p>
      <ol start="3" type="1">
        <li><strong>Creation of a new mandate</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        As the previous mandate has expired after 6 years, the junior treasurer
        has created a new mandate with the following signatories to be added:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Matias Wang Almeida e Silva</li>
        <li>John-Joseph Gray</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The committee notes that Matias has submitted a
        <code>pws-msc-62831</code> form to HSBC.
