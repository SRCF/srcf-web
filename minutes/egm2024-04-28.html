<h2>Improving SRCF publicity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Publicity for SRCF seems low despite the large range of society that rely on SRCF's services.</li>
  <li>Suggestion to put a banner at bottom of websites hosted by SRCF.</li>
  <li>Further suggestion for a banner at bottom of emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Email Systems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SRCF systems are downstream of university email systems, which are being shutdown.</li>
  <li>To continue service, we therefore need to remove this dependence.</li>
  <li>If we change to receive email directly, we will no longer be able to rely on the university's spam filtering systems.</li>
  <li>There may still be a university wide system for outgoing mail.</li>
  <li>Current date for university system shutdown is October 2024.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggestion from Berkley CSUA to backup systems between the two societies.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Need to check how much disk space we have available, and how much data Berkley wishes to backup to us.</li>
  <li>SRCF systems currently have 5TB used of 20TB.</li>
  <li>Unsure how much of this is user directories, which is the intended data to backup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>25th anniversary annual dinner</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All SRCF members will be invited.</li>
  <li>SRCF membership is for life so this includes all past and currently active members.</li>
  <li>Suggestion to partially fund the dinner, perhaps only for previous donors.</li>
  <li>Suggestion to send out an email with the date for the dinner to gather expressions of interest, with further details to follow later.</li>
  <li>Provisionally agreed on Sunday 16th June.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check on executive chat if there is sysadmin bandwidth available to support setting up backup with Berkley CSUA.</li>
  <li>Check how much data Berkley CSUA would request to backup to SRCF.</li>
  <li>Plan 25th anniversary dinner.</li>
  <li>Finalise decision on date and venue for 25th anniversary dinner.</li>
</ul>
