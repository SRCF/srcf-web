      <p>Historic references to ‘sysadmins’ and ‘system administrators’ refer to the SRCF position of System
        Administrator, as described on <a href="/roles" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">https://www.srcf.net/roles</a> as of Monday 20th July 2020 (below). Item <code>1</code> in
        these minutes redefines the role of ‘system administrator’. When references to the new role are used, they will
        mention this item.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The job of sysadmin is not particularly a glamorous one, but it is one of the most important: the SRCF could
          struggle along without a committee, but without the sysadmin team the service would grind quickly to a halt.
        </p>
        <p>Much of the day-to-day administration of the SRCF involves responding to user requests, either by running one
          of the SRCF scripts to create a database or add a user or whatever, or by explaining patiently why what they
          want is stupid. The simplest requests can be dealt with by anyone with a shell and a keyboard, but
          occasionally a closer familiarity with what is actually going on, and some greater ingenuity and problem
          solving, is required.</p>
        <p>The admins are also responsible for developing and maintaining the scripts and tools to make life easier for
          both themselves and the users, so software-engineer types will have some opportunity to exercise their skills.
          The SRCF has been writing scripts for more than a decade, and some 2000-vintage Python and Perl is still in
          operation, so there’s plenty of modernisation work to do.</p>
        <p>Since system administration is a shared responsibility, the amount demanded of any individual is not too
          severe. Each admin is mostly welcome to pick and choose which tasks they are willing and able to deal with,
          and focus on those. If you do nothing at all, and do not intend to start doing anything, we would appreciate
          it if you would give up your admin rights to simplify bookkeeping, but as long as you are doing something,
          even if that’s just approving membership requests or fixing the permissions on a society account, you are
          freeing up the time of people who can do more involved things, like script development or service deployment.
        </p>
        <p>Some experience of system administration is preferable, but of course we realise that the SRCF is a place
          that many people go to gain that experience; however, knowing your way around the Linux command line is
          probably essential if you are to carry out any serious administrative work. If you lack that experience but
          are still keen to help the SRCF, don’t be discouraged – there’s a good chance we will be able to find
          something else for you to do. Just ask!</p>

      <h2 id="Items">Items</h2>
      <h3 id="1-Clarify-What-It-Means-to-Be-a-System-Administrator"><code>1</code> Clarify What It Means to Be a System
        Administrator</h3>
      <p>It is evident that the ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to the administration of SRCF machines is outdated. Newer
        services such as Timeout and other upcoming projects rely on the help of volunteers that have partial access to
        these machines and, in some cases, root access on a select few.</p>
      <p>The committee, therefore, wishes to distinguish between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a ‘system administrator’, who has root access to all of the SRCF’s machines,</li>
        <li>and a ‘volunteer’, who may exercise some duties under the capacity of root on some machines. It is at the
          discretion of the system administrators which machines these volunteers have root access to.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="2-Clarify-the-Process-of-Appointing-a-New-System-Administrator"><code>2</code> Clarify the Process of
        Appointing a New System Administrator</h3>
      <p>Presently, the <a href="/constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SRCF Constitution
          §5.2</a> states that:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>[The committee] shall be responsible for the appointment of system administrators, who shall be responsible
          to the Committee.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The committee recognizes that the procedure for the appointment of system administrators has on occasion been
        informal, to the extent that it casts doubts as to what the procedure entails. The committee notes that it has
        always felt that it could intervene in this process if necessary.</p>
      <p>To improve this process, the following is proposed and will henceforth be the current committee’s
        implementation of §5.2:</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The existing team of system administrators will be free to recruit and vet any potential candidates as they
        always have.</p>
      <p>To appoint a new system administrator, a motion should be brought to the committee by email. The motion should
        contain the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name of the candidate</li>
        <li>CRSid of the candidate</li>
        <li>A comment from the candidate as to why they would like to become a system administrator</li>
        <li>A recommendation from the system administrator team</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The committee will proceed to vote on the motion. The results of the said vote will be provided to the system
        administrator team.</p>
      <p>The committee expects that the majority of these motions will be proposed by the existing system administrator
        team. The committee also notes that there may be a reasonable time delay from the internal appointment of a
        system administrator to its communication to the public via the minutes.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="3-Appointment-of-System-Administrators"><code>3</code> Appointment of System Administrators</h3>
      <p>The committee wishes to acknowledge that, historically, the appointment of system administrators has been
        poorly recorded. This has caused some confusion regarding the status of existing system administrators.</p>
      <p>The committee wishes to clarify that all existing system administrators are, and to the best of the committee’s
        knowledge, and have always been authorized to perform the functions of a system administrator.</p>
      <p>The committee agrees to appoint Timo Wilken (<code>tw466</code>) and Daniel Carter (<code>dcc52</code>) as
        system administrators, as defined in item <code>1</code>. They are two most recent additions to the system
        administrator team. Their status was previously unclear as there had been no written evidence of their status
        until now.</p>
      <h3 id="4-Appointment-of-Volunteers"><code>4</code> Appointment of Volunteers</h3>
      <p>The committee wishes to approve the following people as ‘volunteers’, as defined in item <code>1</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Matias Silva (<code>mw781</code>)</li>
        <li>John-Joseph Gray (<code>jjag3</code>)</li>
        <li>Mary Chester-Kadwell (<code>mec31</code>)</li>
        <li>Charlie Jonas (<code>chtj2</code>)</li>
        <li>Daniel Burgess (<code>deb31</code>)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="5-Removal-of-Inactive-System-Administrators"><code>5</code> Removal of Inactive System Administrators</h3>
      <p>At this time, the committee finds it appropriate to update the current system administrator list by removing
        inactive accounts.</p>
      <p>The committee has deemed that an active system administrator shall be one that has logged in to the
        <code>pip</code> server with root privileges at any point in the year preceding 20/07/2020.</p>
      <p>Deletions in the table below represent the inactive system administrators who will have their root privileges
        revoked. The remaining names will keep their root privileges.</p>
