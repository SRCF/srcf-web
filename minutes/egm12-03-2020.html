      <h3 id="discussion-of-roles">Discussion of roles</h3>
      <p>
        Chair discussed expansion of publicity work. Someone noted that
        publicity officer role was made up by someone to give themself a
        committee position. But it’s good that we’re tinking about these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone noted that other societies don’t know about SRCF: went to AGM,
        IT officer did not realize society had account with SRCF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Senior Treasurer made note on being senior treasurer and how senior vs
        junior treasurerism works. Claimed responsibility of society debt, to
        disagreement of constitution, no resolution made, decided was not
        important because society is solvent. Discussion of Proctors’
        recommendation.
